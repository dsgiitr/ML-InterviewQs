- title: Difference between LSTMs and GRUs
  type: mcq
  text: Which of the following is not true with respect to LSTMs and GRUs?
  opt:
    - Both LSTM and GRU cells have a gating mechanism. An LSTM cell has three gates, while a GRU cell has two.
    - LSTM has a memory cell state while GRU, similar to RNN does not.
    - The LSTM cells use tanh and sigmoid non-linearities in its update equations while the GRU cells use only tanh.
    - A GRU cell has a lower number of parameters than an LSTM cell.
  ans: 
    - The LSTM cells use tanh and sigmoid non-linearities in its update equations while the GRU cells use only tanh.
  q_img: NULL
  sol:
    The update equation of the GRU cells also uses both tanh and sigmoid functions.
  sol_img: NULL
