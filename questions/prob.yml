- title: Question on Monty Hall's Problem
  type: num
  text: Suppose you are at an interview and the interviewer gives you 11 purse and you need to choose one. One of them has a gold coin and rest of them has stone. You choose purse x then the interviewer opens one purse y which has a stone in it. Now you have a choice to go with your choice or switch to any of the remaining 9 purses. What is the probability you will win this game if you switch?(Give your answer to three places of decimal)
  opt: NULL
  ans: 0.101

  sol: Let's say you choose purse 1, the probability of your winning is 1/11 as each of the 11 purses have an equally likely chance of containing a gold coin. So the probability that other purses might contain the coin is 10/11. Now let's say interviewer opens purse 2 and shows you it has a stone. Now the original 10/11 probability shifts to the other 9 purses and if you switch you are going to choose one of the purse so probability of your winning is 1/9*10/11 which is 0.101
