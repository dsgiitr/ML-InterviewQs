# New to Open Source?

If you are new to contributing to open source, [this guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) helps explain why, what, and how to get involved. Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

We thank you for investing your time in contributing to this project!


### Create a new Issue
If you spot a problem in this repository, or need to request a new tag, or a new key, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/dsgiitr/ML-InterviewQs/issues/new/choose).

### Solve an Issue
Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/dsgiitr/ML-InterviewQs/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using ```labels``` as filters. See [Labels](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/contributing/how-to-use-labels.md) for more information.

### Style guide
We follow standard effective yaml guidelines. You can refer to [this guide](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/documenting/yaml-style-guide/) for more information.

Keep these in mind while creating a pull request:

- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments.
