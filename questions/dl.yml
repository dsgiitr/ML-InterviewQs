  title: Difference between LSTMs and GRUs
  type: mcq
  text: Which of the following is not true with respect to LSTMs and GRUs
  opt:
    - Both LSTM and GRUs have gating units. LSTMs have three gates while GRUs have two.
    - LSTM has a memory cell state while GRU similar to RNN does not.
    - The LSTM uses tanh and sigmoid non-linearities in its update equations while GRU uses only tanh.
    - GRU has a lower number of parameters than LSTM
  ans: 
    - The LSTM uses tanh and sigmoid non-linearities in its update equations while GRU uses only tanh.
  q_img: NULL
  sol:
    The update equation of GRU also uses both tanh and sigmoid functions.
