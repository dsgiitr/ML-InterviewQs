# Contribution Guide
Welcome to DSG's Machine Learning Interview Questions contribution guide. We thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! 

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New contributer guide
To get an overview of the project, read the README. Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

## Getting Started
We store all of the questions in ```.yaml``` files. For more information about ```.yaml``` files, you can go through these resources:

- [The official YAML website](https://yaml.org/)
- [YAML Syntax](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html)

### Issues

#### Create a new Issue
If you spot a problem in this repository, or need to request a new tag, or a new key, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/dsgiitr/ML-InterviewQs/issues/new/choose).

#### Solve an Issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/dsgiitr/ML-InterviewQs/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using ```labels``` as filters. See [Labels](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/contributing/how-to-use-labels.md) for more information. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Add questions

#### Segregation

We have divided all the questions into five broad categories: 

- [Machine Learning](https://github.com/dsgiitr/ML-InterviewQs/questions/ml.yml)
- [Deep Learning](https://github.com/dsgiitr/ML-InterviewQs/questions/dl.yml)
- [Probability and Statistics](https://github.com/dsgiitr/ML-InterviewQs/questions/prob.yml)
- [Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/dsgiitr/ML-InterviewQs/questions/rl.yml)
- [Miscellaneous](https://github.com/dsgiitr/ML-InterviewQs/questions/misc.yml) 

To request the addition of a new category you can [create an issue](#Create-a-new-Issue).

#### YAML list of acceptable values for each key
Each of the five ```.yaml``` files that contain questions, have
