  title: CPU (Central Processing Unit) vs GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)
  type: mcq
  text: Which of the following is not true?
  opt:
    - CPU is composed of a few individually powerful cores.
    - GPU is composed of a large number of weaker cores.
    - If we want to add two 4*4 matrices, GPU will be much faster than CPU.
    - CPU performs all computations sequentially.
  ans: 
    - If we want to add two 4*4 matrices, GPU will be much faster than CPU.
  q_img: NULL
  sol:
    Adding two 4*4 matrices can be done parallelly with 16 parallel operations. However, very few cores are required for the same. Individually, a CPU's core is more powerful than that of a GPU; hence a CPU will outperform a GPU in this task. When the matrix size increases, a GPU will outperform a CPU.
