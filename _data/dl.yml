- title: Difference between LSTMs and GRUs
  type: mcq
  text: Which of the following is not true with respect to LSTMs and GRUs?
  opt:
    - Both LSTM and GRU cells have a gating mechanism. An LSTM cell has three gates, while a GRU cell has two.
    - LSTM has a memory cell state while GRU, similar to RNN does not.
    - The LSTM cells use tanh and sigmoid non-linearities in its update equations while the GRU cells use only tanh.
    - A GRU cell has a lower number of parameters than an LSTM cell.
  ans: 
    - The LSTM cells use tanh and sigmoid non-linearities in its update equations while the GRU cells use only tanh.
  q_img: NULL
  sol:
    The update equation of the GRU cells also uses both tanh and sigmoid functions.

- title: Discussing dropout 
  type: mcq
  text: Which of the following are true regarding dropout?
  opt:
    - Dropout is similar to bagging training.
    - Dropout needs to be turned off during testing.
    - Both of the above.
    - Causes the model to overfit on the training data.
  ans: 
    - Dropout needs to be turned off during testing.
  q_img: NULL
  sol:
    Dropout needs to be turned off during testing as we want the entire representational capacity of the model during testing. 
    Dropout is similar to a bagging model but there are a few key differences. 
    First in bagging the models are trained independently of each other whereas the dropout models share parameters with each other. 
    Second, in bagging each individual model is trained to convergence while that is not the case in dropout (where each model is trained for 1 step).
    Further D is incorrect since dropout helps reduce overfitting.
